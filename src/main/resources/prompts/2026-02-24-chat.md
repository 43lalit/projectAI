## User
In my projectAI I want to write an API that would systematically download the MDRM file from location `https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/mdrm/pdf/MDRM.zip` and will read the file and will load the file in database. i have specified the details of database connection in application.properties. i want staging table to be re-created everytime i read the file. can you generate the code for it and test run

## Assistant
Implemented MDRM ingestion API/service/scheduler with staging table recreation, plus tests.

## User
I downloaded the file MDRM_CSV so that you dont get DNS error. I have placed it under FedFiles directory under resources. can you update the code to read from there instead of pinging fed reserve website and test run

## Assistant
Updated loader to read from `src/main/resources/FedFiles/MDRM_CSV.csv` and adjusted tests.

## User
lets install maven then

## Assistant
Installed Maven via Homebrew and validated with `mvn -v`.

## User
yes. lets trigger POST

## Assistant
Started app, triggered `POST /api/mdrm/load`, and confirmed success response.

## User
okay looks like csv file is not read. in the csv ignore first line. the second line has all column headers. I want staging table to be based on that. can you update the code to read the file correctly and load it. delete staging table and re-create if you want to

## Assistant
Updated parser to skip line 1, use line 2 as headers, recreate staging table from headers, and batch load rows. Verified by API run and tests.

## User
while reviewing code i dont see much comments. i prefer to have comments above functions, classes indicating what they do. its easier to understand for any developer once code matures

## Assistant
Added JavaDoc comments across MDRM classes and methods.

## User
also, i want all exception messages to be maintained in constants file so that later on i need to change the message i dont need to browse the code. its easier to maintain. i also prefer hardcoded values also to be moved to some sort of constants or properties file for easier maintenance.

## Assistant
Created `MdrmConstants` and moved exception messages + key literals/defaults into constants; refactored code to use them.

## User
what do you think about the recommendations i made. did they made sense?

## Assistant
Confirmed recommendations are solid for maintainability and consistency.

## User
can you generate javadocs that i can see

## Assistant
Generated JavaDocs with Maven at `target/site/apidocs/index.html`.

## User
do you recommend to create a seperate UI application if i want to call API via button or prefer to create UI component in this package itself

## Assistant
Recommended in-project UI first for fastest path.

## User
okay. then lets create fastest path. can you help generate

## Assistant
Added in-project UI page with button to trigger load API.

## User
this looks good. now i want html page where i can select the reporting from and for that it loads me all the data in table format.

## Assistant
Added new APIs for reporting forms + filtered data and created reporting viewer page.

## User
can you render the style of the html pages. get me the good stylesheet. also, instead of typing 2 different html pages, give me menu options.

## Assistant
Created shared stylesheet and unified `index.html` console with menu tabs (`Load MDRM`, `Reporting Viewer`), and redirected old pages.

## User
can you save our chat under resources folder, create new directory prompts and save it with today's date

## Assistant
