# ProjectAI Chat Notes - 2026-03-01

## Summary
This session focused on production polish across discovery/search UX, favorites behavior, dark mode readability, item-type semantics, and recent-history (phase 1 + phase 2).

## Work Completed
- Added item type code-to-value translation for display/query surfaces:
  - `J` Projected
  - `D` Derived
  - `F` Financial/reported
  - `R` Rate
  - `S` Structure
  - `E` Examination/supervision
  - `P` Percentage
- Added `MDRM Type` column in Discovery AG Grid.
- Added and refined favorites behavior in Discovery:
  - favorites-first initial ordering
  - sortable `Favorite` column
  - improved star behavior across cards/results
- Dark mode fixes for readability:
  - stronger table text/stripe/hover contrast
  - run-metrics grid visibility corrected in dark mode
- Header/nav consistency updates:
  - icon-based colorful menu style
  - propagated across pages
  - removed separate MDRM top menu entry
- Added Recent Items (max 10) as quick-access cards:
  - cards for report/mdrm with icons
  - bookmark star per recent card (empty vs gold)
  - clear action support
- Implemented Recent Items Phase 2 backend persistence:
  - per-user server store with fallback to local cache
  - API endpoints:
    - `GET /api/recent/items?limit=10`
    - `POST /api/recent/items?limit=10`
    - `DELETE /api/recent/items`
- UX refinements after review:
  - moved Recent Items as a separate panel above Search & Discovery
  - removed unnecessary pre-search guidance text

## New Backend Components
- `src/main/java/com/projectai/projectai/recent/RecentController.java`
- `src/main/java/com/projectai/projectai/recent/RecentService.java`
- `src/main/java/com/projectai/projectai/recent/RecentModels.java`

## Notes
- Recent items now prioritize usability:
  - visible at landing top area
  - not pushed below large result sets
  - local fallback maintained for resilience
